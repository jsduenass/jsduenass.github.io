For starters apt is not working.
I found as well one of the issues I have had while running ubuntu in my computer and is that the sound does not quite work link</description></item><item><title>Introduction to programming</title><link>https://jsduenass.github.io/posts/programming/intro/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jsduenass.github.io/posts/programming/intro/</guid><description>What is programming? Well, I think that is a muddy question, because it encapsulates a wide range of activities with an even broader set of tools. If I had to give you a short definition it would be that programming is laying a set of rules for the computer to follow. It sounds extremely simple, but it is a process you can build upon and iterate layer over layer until these instructions create amazing software with complex functionality.</description></item><item><title>MATLAB</title><link>https://jsduenass.github.io/posts/programming/robocup/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jsduenass.github.io/posts/programming/robocup/</guid><description>Esta es la pagina principal para almacenar la informaciÃ³n relacionada con MATLAB</description></item><item><title>Raspbery pi</title><link>https://jsduenass.github.io/posts/programming/raspi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jsduenass.github.io/posts/programming/raspi/</guid><description>Getting started with a raspberry pi
Configuration There are many ways of configuring network interfaces via modifying configuration files .
sudo raspi-config sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf service networking reload
service networking restart Find Raspbery PI hostname
whoami #username ping &amp;lt;hostname&amp;gt;.local -4
ssh &amp;lt;username&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;hostname&amp;gt;
sudo ifconfig eth0 up
sudo matlab-rpi-setup Configure SSH Multiple private keys can be added using ssh-add``. However for this to work the _ssh-agent_ must be activated. To check if it activated Open power shell and get information about the service if it is stoped, ssh-add`` won&amp;rsquo;t work.</description></item></channel></rss>
