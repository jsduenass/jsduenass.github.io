Well, I think that is a muddy question, because it encapsulates a wide range of activities with an even broader set of tools. If I had to give you a short definition it would be that programming is laying a set of rules for the computer to follow. It sounds extremely simple, but it is a process you can build upon and iterate layer over layer until these instructions create amazing software with complex functionality.</description></item><item><title>Robocup Virtual manipulator challenge</title><link>https://jsduenass.github.io/posts/programming/robocup/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jsduenass.github.io/posts/programming/robocup/</guid><description>virtual manipulator demo Resources Virtual manipulator challenge main page Video introduction source code Blog Other resources Pick-and-Place Workflow in Gazebo Using Point-Cloud Processing and RRT Path Planning Robocup@work team qualifications Robocup@home team qualifications Github getting started Design and Control of Robot Manipulators Get started with gazebo Objective Crate an algorithm for the robotic arm so it can sort properly the cans and bottles.

Configuration There are many ways of configuring network interfaces via modifying configuration files .
sudo raspi-config sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf service networking reload
service networking restart Find Raspbery PI hostname
whoami #username ping &amp;lt;hostname&amp;gt;.local -4
ssh &amp;lt;username&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;hostname&amp;gt;
sudo ifconfig eth0 up
sudo matlab-rpi-setup Configure SSH Multiple private keys can be added using ssh-add``. However for this to work the _ssh-agent_ must be activated. To check if it activated Open power shell and get information about the service if it is stoped, ssh-add`` won&amp;rsquo;t work.</description></item></channel></rss>
