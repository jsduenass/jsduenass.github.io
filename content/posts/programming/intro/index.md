## What is programming? 
Well, I think that is a muddy question because it encapsulates a wide range of activities with an even broader set of tools. If I had to give you a short definition it would be that programming is laying a set of rules for the computer to follow. It sounds extremely simple but it is a process you can build upon and iterate layer over layer until these instructions  create amazing software with complex functionality. 

There has to be  a lot of patience in this process because programming is slow, full of walls you have to smash your head against many times until you realize there is actually a path around, it is building and tearing down your own creations because things are going to fail a lot!!! so you have to be ready to let go and try new perspectives. Now that you have a taste of what is in front of you is just natural to set a goal something you want to accomplish a project and try to find the knowledge you'll need to make it work.
