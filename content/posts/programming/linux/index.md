## How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love linux
-->

## My Setup 

I am currently running in a dual-boot both Windows and Ubuntu 2020 focal Fossa. is a set-up I configure a while ago hoped I had documented it. because As soon as I open it had a couple of issues. For starters ```apt``` is not working. 


I found as well one of the issues I have had while running ubuntu in my computer and is  that the sound does not quite work [link](https://askubuntu.com/questions/926463/subwoofer-doest-work-in-lenovo-y700)
