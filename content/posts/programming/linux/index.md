## How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love linux
-->

## My Setup 

I am currently running in a dual-boot both Windows and Ubuntu 2020 focal Fossa. is a set-up I configure a while ago hoped I had documented it. because As soon as I open it had a couple of issues. For starters ```apt``` is not working. 


I found as well one of the issues I have had while running ubuntu in my computer and is  that the sound does not quite work [link](https://askubuntu.com/questions/926463/subwoofer-doest-work-in-lenovo-y700)

ubuntu-drivers devices
sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall



## ROS 
Getting started with ROS. follow the wiki (instructions)[http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu]


```

roscore
rosnode list

```

find enviromental ROS variable 
export | grep ROS




## Bash 

source does not allow nested calling

```
echo $PS1     # determine if shell is running in interactive mode

echo $-
# himBHs

echo $0
```
