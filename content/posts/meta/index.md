Yeah, may be another presentation might be an overkill, I am guessing you have already read the __[about section](/#about)__  which holds a formal presentation of who I am. This however is a more lay back version where I intend to explore and document the experiences while creating this website.

Let's start from the beginning, I been thinking about writing for a long time but struggle to keep it up. I don't know when you are reading this but 2020/2021 have been period defined by a global pandemic which caused a rapid adoption of digital technologies. The times are changing so adapt to this new world with a bigger presence is a must.

That is why I start this project. If you want to get started creating a website of your own there a many alternatives, actually, too many. So many that it can become overwhelming. If you are wondering how this one in particular is made I used [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) a static website builder based on ```go```, HUGO works via __themes__ to get a particular feel and aestethic I used the [hugo toha theme](https://hugo-toha.github.io) and ```fork``` a exemplary [git repository](https://github.com/hugo-toha/hugo-toha.github.io) which holds a generic site.  

> Spoilers: the template supports multilingual the forked example was in Bengali (à¦¬à¦¾à¦‚à¦²à¦¾) ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡©. 

This is not my first try with HUGO, while back I tried using it with a different template. In the end I didn't feel very confortable using it because my lack of experience but trying it again feels a bit easier do to the fact that I have already tried it and being more familiar might influence. 

Starting a new project may be hard, you would find roadblocks that stop you right in your tracks, you might quit but even then it is not a waste of time if you ever return you no longer start from zero and bit by bit you get to advance. 


If you have gone this far I really appreciate it and hope you find the rest of the content in this posts just as interesting if not even more. Please reach out and share those projects you are or have worked on where you have encounter roadblocks I would enjoy to hear your stories.
