## Spare parts by  Joshua Davis 

I found their underdog story raising to accomplish great prowess in engineering inspiring. I could not help but compare their experiences across the different stages in their life journey and my own as it relates to robotics. I was drawn to finally read the book by the increase hostility I have seen in the public discussion about undocumented immigrants/ illegal aliens (how the semantics affect the sympathy we feel towards them). I am not sure if it is refreshing to know that the current turn for the worse, is not necessarily a new unprecedented phenomenon but the resurface of long-standing resentment towards “The other”. Knowing that the stigma existed as well 20 years ago gives some perspective not to be caught by the doom of present moment and work towards flipping the direction of the tide. A nitpick that sometimes bothered me was the way the story was mediated by the author, as I felt that some of his preconceive notions creep in, and in order to construct a narrative he typecast the participants in constrain roles that hinder the ability to hear their stories through the voices.
