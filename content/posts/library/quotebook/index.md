## Literature

> The fact we live at the bottom of a deep gravity well, on the surface of a gas covered planet going around a nuclear fireball 90 million miles away and think this to be normal is obviously some indication of how skewed or perspective tends to be. 
>
> __--- Douglas Adams__


> still couldn't accept that meaning and solace aren't to be found on the heavens but in the tranches of everyday living

## Math and engineering

>figuring out mathematical operations and tricks certainly takes significant  amounts  of  effort,  time,  and  devotion.  Today,  we  often  take  for  granted  those  symbols  and explanations that are neatly compiled into math and science textbooks. It is easy to forget that every  equation  encases  a  story:  frustration,  fascination,  arduous  work,  friendly  collaborations,  disappointment, and the occasional serendipity. Mathematics is not just about numbers, but it is also about the people whose work gives us the luxury and pleasure of understanding.
